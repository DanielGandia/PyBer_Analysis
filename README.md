# PyBer_Analysis

## Purpose of the analysis: 
Analyze the companies ride share data for the urban, suburban and rural city types and provide suggestions based on the results obtained. 
## Resources
Data Sources: ride_data.csv, city_data.csv

Software: Python 3.8.3, Jupyter Notebook 6.1.4, Visual Studio Code 1.54
## Results: 

After gathering and organizing the data for the ride-sharing service in several city type, the results reflect that the majority of the rides are for the Urban city type. The results also reflect that there are 780 more drivers available for the Urban area that rides. The Rural city type has 78 drivers for its 125 rides. The Suburban city type has 490 drivers for its 625 rides. Both of these City types have more rides than drivers. The data also shows that the fares in the Urban area are lower than both of the other 2 city types. Another point that the analysis shows is that the average driver fare is much higher in the Rural city type at $55.49 compares to a lower fare for Suburban areas at $39.50 and a much lower fare of $16.57 for Urban areas. 

Below are a table and a chart visualizing the resulst of the data:

## Summary: 

Since the Urban area has an excess of drivers, a way to help spread the work around is to have some drivers also work in the Suburban and Rural areas. Below are three suggestions to assist with moving drivers to work in other areas:

1. Encourage drivers to also work the Rural and Suburban areas by creating incentive programs.

2. Lower the driver fares for Rural areas to have drivers actually earn on rides.

3. Raise the ride fares for both Suburban and Rural areas to increase earnings for drivers. 

These ideas could potentially help with the excess of drivers in the Urban area and at the same time address the earnings gap with the other city types.
